# `notationTex`: Definitions for consistent, usable notation for math and CS concepts in LaTeX

This package provides a set of definitions for commonly used mathematical and computer science notations in
LaTeX, by concept rather than visual style. This allows you to express what _kind_ of mathematical or CS
object you are defining or using rather than specifying how it should look visually.

In addition, the notational elements used downstream are tracked and a clear notation table can be generated
for the notation elements used in a document.

# Quick Start


## 1. Installation

This package is (will be) available on CTAN and can be installed using your LaTeX package manager.

## 2. Using Notation

### Basic Usage

After installation, simply load the package in your LaTeX document preamble:

```latex
\usepackage{notationTex}
```

Once loaded, you can reference the provided notation elements in your document in the normal
function/macro/operator syntax.

### Custom Notation

# Contributing
For a local installation, first ensure you have a working LaTeX installation. The package is developed and
tested with TeX Live, so it is recommended to use that. Note that your tex distribution must have the
[`dsfont`](https://ctan.org/pkg/doublestroke?lang=en) package installed; this can be installed on a linux
system vis `sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra`, for example.

Then, clone this repository and run the following command to build the package:

```bash
latex notationTex.ins
l3build doc
latexmk -pdf examples/demo.tex
```

This should build the demo document and the package documentation.
